# alavai — Implementation Plan

A native, pure-Rust Tailscale GUI for Linux that makes **one-click tailnet
switching** a first-class action and ships as a **lightweight, distro- and
DE/WM-agnostic** binary. It aims for feature parity with
[trayscale](https://github.com/DeedleFake/trayscale) (GTK/Go), which serves as
the feature reference.

This document is the roadmap. It is organised as:

1. [Design decisions](#1-design-decisions)
2. [Architecture](#2-architecture) (see also [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md))
3. [Feature parity matrix](#3-feature-parity-matrix) — every trayscale feature, mapped
4. [Phased delivery plan](#4-phased-delivery-plan)
5. [Risks & open questions](#5-risks--open-questions)

## 1. Design decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | Rust 2024 | requested; single static-ish binary |
| Tailscale access | **Custom LocalAPI client** over `tailscaled.sock` | no Go, no bundled `tailscale.com` lib; validated against a live daemon (status + profile list/switch work). Mirrors trayscale's use of `tailscale.com/client/local`. |
| Up/down/login | LocalAPI where possible, shell `tailscale` as fallback | trayscale itself shells out for `up`/`down`; we prefer LocalAPI (`EditPrefs` + `Start`, `login-interactive`) and fall back to the CLI only if needed |
| netcheck | shell `tailscale netcheck --format=json` | LocalAPI does not expose a full netcheck report cleanly; the CLI does. Avoids reimplementing DERP probing. |
| Tray | `ksni` (StatusNotifierItem over D-Bus) | pure Rust; works on KDE, GNOME (+extension), and most WMs; this is where one-click switching lives |
| GUI | `iced` | pure Rust, no GTK/Qt **system** libraries, single binary, consistent look in any DE/WM, software-render fallback for any distro |
| Concurrency | OS threads + channels (no async runtime) | the `watch-ipn-bus` stream is a long-lived blocking read on its own thread; this keeps the binary lean and avoids mixing an async runtime with ksni's blocking API. Revisit `tokio` only if a future feature truly needs it. |
| Notifications | `notify-rust` | freedesktop `org.freedesktop.Notifications`; DE-agnostic |
| Config | `toml` + `directories` (XDG) | lets the user pin/order tailnets for the tray; stores prefs (tray on/off, poll interval) without GNOME `gsettings` |

**Why not GTK4 + libadwaita (what trayscale uses)?** The user explicitly does not
need matching look/workflow — only features — and wants a lightweight binary that
runs cleanly on any distro and any DE/WM. GTK4/libadwaita pulls heavy system
dependencies and renders with a distinctly GNOME look. `iced` keeps the binary
self-contained and visually neutral everywhere.

**Alternatives considered for GUI:** `slint` (also pure Rust, lighter binary, strong
software renderer) is a viable fallback if `iced`'s wgpu backend proves
troublesome on exotic GPUs; `egui` is lighter still but looks tool-like. `iced`'s
Elm architecture maps cleanly onto the poller→update event model trayscale
already uses.

```

- **`localapi`** — typed client. Phase 0 is blocking (one request per call);
  Phase 2 adds an async client plus a `watch-ipn-bus` subscriber that yields a
  stream of notifications (state, prefs, netmap, engine, browse-to-URL).
- **state engine** — owns the canonical app state, fed by the watch stream and a
  fallback interval poll (mirrors trayscale's `Poller`). Broadcasts snapshots to
  the tray and GUI via a `tokio::sync::watch`/`broadcast` channel. Serialises
  mutating commands.
- **tray** — renders the SNI menu and, crucially, the **tailnet switcher** as
  top-level one-click items. Reflects live status (icon: connected / disconnected
  / exit-node-active) and the active tailnet (`●`).
- **gui** — the optional main window with full per-peer detail, exit nodes,
  Mullvad, Taildrop, netcheck, routes, settings. Opened from the tray.

Data flows one way (daemon → state → views); views send commands back through the
state engine, which calls the LocalAPI and lets the resulting watch event update
everything. This avoids UI/daemon state drift.

## 4. Phased delivery plan

Each phase is independently useful and ends in something runnable.

### Phase 0 — Repo + LocalAPI core + CLI  ✅ (this commit)
- Git repo, license, docs, `iced`/`ksni`-ready `Cargo.toml`.
- Blocking `localapi` client: `status`, `profiles`, `current_profile`,
  `switch_profile`.
- CLI: `alavai status | tailnets | switch <tailnet>`.
- **Proves the headline path in Rust against a live daemon.**

### Phase 1 — Tray daemon with one-click tailnet switching  ✅
- `ksni` (blocking API) SNI tray icon + menu — `alavai tray`.
- Radio-group tailnet switcher: one click → `switch_profile`, with optimistic
  active indicator and worker-thread confirmation.
- Connect/disconnect, manual refresh, quit.
- Status-driven themed icon (connected / disconnected / exit-node) + tooltip.
- 5s interval refresh (watch stream replaces it in Phase 2).
- Non-blocking menu callbacks (channel → worker thread owning the client).
- **Delivered: the headline feature, usable from the system tray.**

### Phase 2 — Event-driven state via `watch-ipn-bus`  ✅
- `Client::watch_live`: a blocking IPN-bus reader (chunked HTTP, newline-delimited
  JSON) on its own thread — **no async runtime, no new dependencies**.
- Folds delta notifications (State / Prefs / NetMap) into a merged `LiveState`
  and emits only on change.
- Tray is now event-driven: online state, exit-node state, machine and address
  update live; the old 5s full poll is gone. Profiles (not on the bus) still poll
  every 10s.
- Auto-reconnects when the stream drops (e.g. after a profile switch).
- `alavai watch` debug subcommand streams `LiveState` changes.
- Verified live: `[online] diablo 100.69.38.30`.

### Phase 3 — GUI shell (iced)  ✅
- `alavai gui`: an iced window using the **tiny-skia software renderer** (no
  wgpu/GPU dependency) — opened from the tray menu or left-click.
- Shows connection state, this machine (with copy buttons), a one-click tailnet
  switcher (pick-list), and the live peer list (online dots, IPs, exit-node tags).
- Stays live via the same `watch_live` stream, exposed as an iced `Subscription`;
  the view is a pure function of one `GuiSnapshot` rebuilt from `status` + profiles.
- Connect/disconnect, copy-to-clipboard, admin-console link.
- Switched ksni to its **async-io** backend so `zbus` runs its own executor —
  iced_winit also opens a session bus, which panics under the tokio backend. Side
  benefit: **tokio is no longer a dependency at all.**

### Phase 4 — Full feature parity  ⬅ next
> **UI design pass first.** Before building these out, the UI is going through a
> design review — see [UI-HANDOVER.md](UI-HANDOVER.md), which describes each
> feature below in user terms and how it should surface in the interface.
>
> **Backend-first progress.** The design-independent plumbing is already done and
> verified via the CLI, ahead of the UI: a typed `prefs()` reader and an
> `edit_prefs` (masked-prefs `PATCH`) writer with safe setters for exit node,
> accept-routes, allow-LAN, advertise-exit-node, and advertise-routes; richer peer
> data (last seen/handshake, rx/tx, relay, primary routes); and `netcheck`.
> Exposed as `alavai prefs | peers | netcheck | exit-node | accept-routes |
> lan-access | advertise-exit-node | advertise-routes`. The GUI just needs to wire
> to these once the design lands.

- Exit nodes (incl. advertise + LAN access), Mullvad picker.
- Advertise/accept routes (add/remove prefixes).
- Taildrop send (dialog + drag-and-drop + "open with") and receive (save/delete).
- netcheck diagnostics panel.
- Add/remove tailnet + interactive login flow; control-server URL.
- Operator check, admin link, preferences, about.

### Phase 5 — Packaging & polish
- `.desktop` file, icon set, autostart entry, `--hide-window`.
- Release profile already size-optimised (`opt-level=z`, LTO, strip).
- Distribution: prebuilt binary + AUR; evaluate Flatpak. CI for build/test/clippy.
- README install docs, screenshots.

## 5. Risks & open questions

- **LocalAPI POST/CSRF:** ✅ resolved. A no-op `POST /profiles/{current}`
  returned `HTTP 204` with only `Host: local-tailscaled.sock` — no CSRF
  rejection. Mutating calls work; `EditPrefs` (PATCH) still to be exercised in
  Phase 2.
- **`watch-ipn-bus` framing:** ✅ resolved. Chunked HTTP carrying
  newline-delimited JSON `Notify` deltas; parsed by a blocking stream thread
  (`Client::watch_live`). No async runtime required.
- **netmap richness:** some per-peer fields trayscale reads come from Go-typed
  views; confirm they're all present in the JSON `status`/netmap. May need
  `tailscale status --json` to supplement.
- **iced wgpu on headless/odd GPUs:** ✅ resolved by building iced with the
  `tiny-skia` software renderer only (no wgpu). Verified: window renders correctly
  over Wayland. Also required switching ksni to the `async-io` zbus backend so
  iced_winit's session-bus connection doesn't panic.
- **Mullvad capability detection:** depends on `CapMap`/tags in the JSON status —
  verify the field names.
